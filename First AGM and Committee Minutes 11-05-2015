2 SUSU Affiliation

Sophia presented an edited version of the standard SUSU society constitution. The edits included a description of the society's aims and the addition of a Publicity Officer to the committee. It was printed and signed by the newly elected President and Secretary. It was also sent to SUSU as part of the student society affiliation online form, along with the newly elected committee list and the MRSS logo.

3 Brainstorm of projects for first year

4 Competitions

Possibilities for running student competitions were discussed. Possibilities include a one-use glider with a 3D printed wing. Students would design their own wing structure in order to produce the 'best' movement.
Other ideas involve pitting a bottle glider against a tupperware AUV.

5 University Open Days

There will be several University Open Days held on July 3rd and 4th, and September 5th and 6th. The University has asked societies to run bunfight-style stands during the open days. Societies will receive £50 funding for each day they run a stand (max. £200). Free lunches will also be provided for each person helping out on the stand (either in the form of packed lunches or lunch tokens). Nutritional information for the members helping on stands may need to be given.
